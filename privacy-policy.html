  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Alam Softwares</p>
  <p><strong>App:</strong> SmartPay Alert</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    SmartPay Alert is built with privacy as the default. The app processes notifications locally on your device to announce incoming payments. 
    There is <strong>no server communication</strong> with Alam Softwares. We do not collect, store, or sell personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>What we do <em>not</em> collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No payment data:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit transaction amounts, bank details, UPI IDs, or any financial data.</li>
    <li><strong>No personal identifiers:</strong> We do not collect your name, phone number, email address, location, or contacts.</li>
    <li><strong>No analytics:</strong> We do not use Firebase, Google Analytics, or similar analytics services.</li>
    <li><strong>No developer servers:</strong> The app does not send any data to Alam Softwares’ servers (we operate none for this app).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Local-only data</h2>
  <p>
    Some information is stored <em>only on your device</em> to make the app work for you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App preferences:</strong> language, voice settings, pitch, speed, amount filters, and chosen apps to monitor.</li>
    <li><strong>Local history (optional):</strong> payment notifications you choose to keep for reference remain on your device only.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can clear this data anytime by using your device’s <em>App info → Storage &amp; cache → Clear storage</em> or by uninstalling the app.</p>

  <h2>Permissions we use and why</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notification access:</strong> to read payment-related notifications from apps you select and convert them to voice announcements. Notification content is not sent off your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Post notifications (Android 13+):</strong> to show local alerts if you enable them.</li>
    <li><strong>Foreground service:</strong> to keep the announcement service reliable while your device is in use.</li>
    <li><strong>Network/Internet:</strong> required <em>only</em> for displaying ads (see “Advertising” below). The core payment alerts work offline.</li>
    <li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> uses your device’s TTS engine to speak alerts. No audio leaves your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    SmartPay Alert displays ads using Google AdMob. Alam Softwares does not collect personal data through ads; however, 
    <strong>Google and its partners may process device information</strong> to deliver and measure ads in accordance with their policies. 
    You can manage ad personalization in your device’s Google settings.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    Note: The presence of AdMob means Google may collect identifiers (such as the Advertising ID) and other device signals for ad delivery and measurement. 
    This is separate from Alam Softwares and controlled by Google’s policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Payments (planned)</h2>
  <p>
    Future versions may include in-app payments (e.g., Razorpay). Payments will be processed by the payment provider, 
    and we will not store transaction details on Alam Softwares’ servers. Any information you share during checkout is handled 
    by the payment provider under their privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    All app preferences and any optional local history remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app. 
    Alam Softwares does not retain any user data on external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because your data remains on your device, your security primarily depends on your device’s protections. 
    We recommend using a device screen lock, keeping your OS updated, and not sharing your device with untrusted users.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices and controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Change or reset app preferences at any time within the app or system settings.</li>
    <li>Revoke notification access in system settings.</li>
    <li>Clear app data or uninstall the app to remove local data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app is suitable for general audiences and does not target children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy to reflect app changes or legal requirements. If we make material changes, we will notify you in-app or via the Play Store listing. 
    Your continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.
  </p>
