  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Alam Softwares</p>
  <p><strong>App:</strong> SmartPay Alert</p>

  <h2>Acceptance</h2>
  <p>
    By downloading or using SmartPay Alert, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.
  </p>

  <h2>License</h2>
  <p>
    We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the app on devices you own or control for personal or business purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>How the app works</h2>
  <p>
    The app reads notifications from payment/banking apps you select and converts relevant payment messages into spoken alerts. 
    Processing happens locally on your device. See our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.
  </p>

  <h2>Your responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Comply with applicable laws and the terms of the payment/banking apps you use.</li>
    <li>Keep your device secure and up to date.</li>
    <li>Configure notification access responsibly and only for apps you trust.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    The app may display ads via Google AdMob and may, in future versions, use a payment provider for upgrades or purchases. 
    Your use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>
    The app is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, Alam Softwares disclaims all warranties, 
    including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. 
    We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation, or accuracy of any alert derived from third-party notifications.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Alam Softwares will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, 
    or exemplary damages, or for any loss of data, revenue, or profits, arising from your use of the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Termination</h2>
  <p>
    You may stop using the app at any time. We may suspend or discontinue the app, or your access to it, if required by law or to protect users and services.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms as the app evolves. Material changes will be noted in-app or on the store listing. Continued use means you accept the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Governing law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Courts in Hyderabad, Telangana, will have jurisdiction, unless local law requires otherwise.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
